# Advanced HTML

## Description

This project is dedicated to exploring the fundamentals of **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language), the standard markup language for creating web pages. Throughout this project, I will learn how to effectively use HTML tags to structure and organize content within a webpage. The emphasis will be on understanding the semantic meaning of various HTML elements rather than on styling, as the final product is intentionally kept “ugly” to focus purely on structure. I will develop an eye for detail, recognizing the importance of syntax and proper tag usage in web development.

## Concepts

- **HTML Basics**: Understanding the fundamental building blocks of HTML and how they fit together to create a web page.
- **HTML Structure**: Learning how to create the basic skeleton of an HTML5 page, including the doctype, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using semantic tags to give meaning to the content of the page, enhancing accessibility and SEO.
- **Block vs Inline Elements**: Knowing when to use `<div>` versus `<span>` for layout and formatting.
- **Semantic Elements**: Understanding the roles of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`.
- **Headings and Hierarchy**: The importance of headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and maintaining a proper hierarchy for content organization.
- **Lists**: Creating ordered and unordered lists using `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements.
- **Media Formats**: Differentiating between image formats such as SVG, GIF, PNG, and JPG, and knowing their use cases.
- **Tables**: Structuring data using HTML tables with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements.
- **Media Integration**: Embedding videos and audio files into webpages using `<video>` and `<audio>` tags.
- **External Content**: Understanding how to embed content from external sources, such as iframes and scripts.
- **Page Structure**: Correctly structuring an HTML page to ensure clarity and maintainability.
